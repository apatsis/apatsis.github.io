    title: "University of Minnesota - Community Summit"
    excerpt: "Following the murder of George Floyd on May 25, 2020, only 6 km from the University of Minnesota Campus, students in the Department of Earth and Environmental Science felt that the university mission to engage and serve was not being accomplished due to a lack of connection with local communities. In response, graduate students and staff from the department organized a one-day workshop between UMN researchers and scientists and communities from across the Twin Cities. Our goal is to initiate and support meaningful relationships between these groups, and build awareness, understanding, and capacity for community-centered research and engagement in the Twin Cities. From these relationships we hope to foster earth science research and curriculum that supports the communityâ€™s priorities. After attending the 2021 event, I have become a member of the organizing team and worked with a planning committee of UMN and community partners to plan the second iteration of the event that we held in 2023.
