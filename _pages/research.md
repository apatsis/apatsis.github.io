    excerpt: "The terrestrial deep subsurface is thought to be one of Earth's largest ecosystems, holding an estimated 15% of global biomass. While these types of environments can be hard to access, Soudan Mine Underground State Park, MN offers a unique opportunity to travel 715 m below the  surface and study microorganisms living in a 2.7 billion year old banded iron formation. Using metagenomic sequencing and bioinformatics, we characterize the taxonomic and metabolic diversity at this site to elucidate community dynamics and understand the role these microbes play in regulating globally important Earth system processes. Pairing these techniques with the geochemistry of the system improves our understanding of how the deep biosphere and geochemical properties of the subsurface are complexly intertwined."
