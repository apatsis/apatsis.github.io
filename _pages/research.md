    excerpt: "The terrestrial deep subsurface is thought to be one of Earth's largest ecosystems, holding an estimated 15% of global biomass. While these types of environments can be hard to access, Soudan Mine Underground State Park, MN offers a unique opportunity to travel 715 m below the Earth's surface and study microorganisms living in a 2.7 billion year old banded iron formation. Using metagenomic sequencing and bioinformatics, we characterize the taxonomic and metabolic diversity of the microbial community at this site to understand the role that deep subsurface microbes play in regulating globally important Earth system processes. Pairing these techniques with geochemical analyses gives us a more comprehensive understanding of biogeochemical cycling in these systems, and informs our understanding of the co-evolution of the Earth and life."
