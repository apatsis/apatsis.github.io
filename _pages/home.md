I'm a geomicrobiologist interested in microbial metabolism, diversity, and biogeography and how microbe-rock-water interactions impact our planet. I care about community-engaged scholarship and aim to build lasting relationships with local community groups to engaging in research, teaching, and outreach that centers the priorities of communities traditionally marginalized within the sciences. As a first-generation college student I care about fostering connections between individuals who hold the first-gen identity and helping them navigate academic spaces. In my free time, you can find enjoying the outdoors with my dogs.

I am currently a PhD Candidate at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities.
